# Quantum Walks
This repository hosts the python simulation code for a one dimensional quantum Hadamard Walk. It was done with the aid of the [Qutip Library](http://qutip.org/). The simulation serves as support for the Special Topics on Quantum Mechanics class' project at Los Andes University, Colombia.
* The Jupyter Notebook can be found on: [Quantum Random Walk](./QRW.ipynb)
